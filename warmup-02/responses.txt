Why did you decide to take this class?

I'm a proffesional UX Designer returning to college to finish my BA so I can get a Masters in AI. I wanted to take this class because it will look good on my portfolio to have a site that i've coded. 

What are a few things you hope to learn?

More about the process of a HTML/CSS developer.

Tell us a little about your image file you uploaded.

I uploaded a dog of my picture Jack because he's a really good boy.
